### Compiling from source code
To preview Boats Animator we recommend using [NW Builder](https://github.com/nwjs/nw-builder). Install it using `npm install evshiron/nw-builder -g`.

After installing NW Builder, in the `animator` directory run: `nwbuild -r app -v 0.14.2`

Alternatively, download version **0.14.2** of [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) and follow the instructions relevant to your operating system on the [NW.js wiki](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/How-to-run-apps).

* Features with the `Webkit` prefix may be used if there is no standardised method available.
* CSS, HTML, JS and JSON should be indented using 2 spaces ([Currently a WIP](https://github.com/BoatsAreRockable/Boats-Animator/issues/140))
* Trailing white space and empty lines with spaces should be avoided.
* HTML classes and ids are `spaced-using-dashes`.
Script variables and functions are `spacedUsingCamelCase`.
* JavaScript functions should be documented using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html).
