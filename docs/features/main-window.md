## Preview area
![Preview area](../img/preview-area.png)

The preview area shows a live feed of the selected camera in [capture mode](#capture-mode) and is where frames are played back in [playback mode](#playback-mode). In capture mode a red border is displayed around the preview area.

## Undo last frame
**Shortcut: `<Ctrl+Z>`**

![Undo last frame](../img/undo-last-frame.png)

Select this to remove the last frame in the frame reel and delete it permanently from the hard-drive. After selecting this a confirm dialogue with "Are you sure you want to delete the last frame captured?" is displayed.

## Frame reel
![Frame reel](../img/frame-reel.png)

The frame reel area displays thumbnails of all of the frames that have been captured. To preview a particular frame in the preview area simply select it from the frame reel. The current frame being previewed will have a white outline around it in the frame reel and playback will begin from this frame.

### Live-view button
On the far right of the frame reel is the live-view button. After previewing captured frames, select this to return to [capture mode](#capture-mode). In capture mode this button has a white outline around it.

## Preview options
![Preview options](../img/preview-options.png)

The preview options buttons change what masks are displayed on the preview area.

### Grid toggle
This enables / disables a [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds) grid over the preview area. **Please note that this feature has not been implemented yet**.

### Onion skinning toggle
This enables / disables [onion skinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_skinning), which is when a translucent version of the last image captured is displayed on top of the preview area. The onion skinning strength is set with the [onion skinning slider](#onion-skinning-slider). Onion skinning is only displayed in [capture mode](#capture-mode).

## Status bar
![Status bar](../img/status-bar.png)

The status bar contains useful information about the current project.

### Current frame
`Frame x of y`

This is an indicator of what is currently being displayed in the preview area. When in capture mode `x` is equal to one more than the number of frames currently captured. The logic here is: "once this picture is taken it will become the `x`th frame captured."

### Current FPS
`xx FPS`

This is the frame rate that will be used to playback frames. The playback frame rate can be adjusted using the [frame rate adjuster](#frame-rate-adjuster).

### Current mode
`x mode`

This is the current mode Boats Animator is in.

#### Capture mode
This is when a live-feed of the selected camera is displayed in the preview area. Capture mode is accessed by selecting the [live-view button](#live-view-button).

#### Playback mode
This is when a captured frame is displayed in the preview area. Preview mode can be accessed either by selecting a captured frame from the [frame reel](#frame-reel) or by selecting the play button.

## Capture button
**Shortcut: `<Ctrl+1>`**

![Capture button](../img/capture-button.png)

Select this button to capture a new frame from the live-feed that is visible in [capture mode](#capture-mode).

## Onion skinning slider
![Onion skinning slider](../img/onion-skinning-slider.png)

This is used to set the amount of [onion skinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_skinning) to be displayed in the preview area in [capture mode](#capture-mode). Move the slider to the left to make the live-feed more visible and to the right to make the last frame captured more visible.

!!! note "Note"
    Remember that this slider only has an effect when the [onion skinning toggle](#onion-skinning-toggle)  is enabled.

## Playback controls
![Playback controls](../img/playback-controls.png)

These buttons affect the playback of captured frames in the [preview area](#preview-area).

### First frame
This previews the first frame captured.

### Previous frame
This previews one frame to the left in the [frame reel](#frame-reel) of the current frame being displayed.

### Playback / pause frames
When this is selected playback will begin from the first frame captured or resume from the current frame being previewed if in [playback mode](#playback-mode).

The playback frames button switches to a pause button during playback. Selecting it pauses playback at the current frame being previewed.

### Stop playback
Select this to stop playback and jump to the last frame captured.

### Next frame
This previews one frame to the right in the [frame reel](#frame-reel) of the current frame being displayed.

### Last frame
This previews the last frame captured.

### Loop playback
Select this to toggle if playback should continue from the first frame captured when the last frame captured is reached.


## Frame rate adjuster
![Frame rate adjuster](../img/frame-rate-adjuster.png)

This is used to set the number of frames per second to be displayed during playback. Whole numbers between 1 and 60 are accepted.

## Sidebar
![Sidebar](../img/sidebar.png)

The sidebar contains options that are generally not changed very often during animating.

### Change resolution and change camera
These features have not been implemented yet, although we are working on doing so and are aware that there is a strong demand for them!

### Change directory
Select this to change the folder Boats Animator exports captured frames to.

!!! warning "Warning"
    Please be aware that Boats Animator will overwrite the existing frames in this directory if it has been used for a project before. This behaviour will be changed in a future version.
